    <h1>Postmortem: Web Stack Debugging Project Outage</h1>

    <h2>Issue Summary:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Duration:</strong> May 10, 2024, 14:00 - May 11, 2024, 02:00 (UTC)</li>
        <li><strong>Impact:</strong> The web application experienced intermittent downtime, affecting 30% of users, resulting in slow response times and service disruptions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Root Cause:</h2>
    <p>The root cause of the outage was identified as a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings, leading to uneven distribution of traffic among backend servers.</p>

    <h2>Timeline:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Detection:</strong> May 10, 2024, 14:00 (UTC) - Monitoring alerts indicated a sudden increase in error rates.</li>
        <li><strong>Actions Taken:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Engineers investigated backend server logs and network configurations.</li>
                <li>Initially assumed the issue was related to database performance due to high query latency.</li>
