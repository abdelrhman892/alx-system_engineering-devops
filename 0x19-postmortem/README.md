# Postmortem: Web Stack Debugging Project Outage

**Issue Summary:**

- **Duration:** May 10, 2024, 14:00 - May 11, 2024, 02:00 (UTC)
- **Impact:** The web application experienced intermittent downtime, affecting 30% of users, resulting in slow response times and service disruptions.

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of the outage was identified as a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings, leading to uneven distribution of traffic among backend servers.

**Timeline:**

- **Detection:** May 10, 2024, 14:00 (UTC) - Monitoring alerts indicated a sudden increase in error rates.
  
**Actions Taken:**

- Engineers investigated backend server logs and network configurations.
- Initially assumed the issue was related to database performance due to high query latency.
  
**Misleading Investigation Paths:**

- Invested time in optimizing database queries, which did not alleviate the issue.
- Suspected a DDoS attack due to the sudden spike in traffic, but network analysis ruled out this possibility.
  
**Escalation:**

The incident was escalated to the network infrastructure team and the DevOps team for further investigation and resolution.

**Resolution:** May 11, 2024, 02:00 (UTC)

After extensive analysis, the misconfiguration in the load balancer was identified and corrected, restoring normal service.

**Root Cause and Resolution:**

- **Root Cause Explanation:** The load balancer was configured with uneven weight distribution among backend servers, causing some servers to handle more traffic than others, leading to performance degradation.
- **Resolution Detail:** The load balancer settings were adjusted to evenly distribute traffic among all backend servers, ensuring optimal performance and reliability.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**

- **Improvements/Fixes:**
  - Implement automated monitoring of load balancer configurations to detect any deviations.
  - Enhance communication channels for rapid escalation and collaboration among teams during incidents.
- **Tasks to Address the Issue:**
  - Update load balancer configuration scripts to ensure uniform distribution of traffic.
  - Conduct regular load testing to identify and address any potential performance bottlenecks.
  - Implement automated deployment pipelines for configuration changes to minimize human error.
  - Document incident response procedures and conduct regular training sessions for the team to improve response efficiency.

**Conclusion:**

The outage was a valuable learning experience, highlighting the importance of thorough monitoring, rapid detection, and collaborative troubleshooting in maintaining the reliability and performance of web applications. By implementing the corrective measures outlined above, we aim to minimize the risk of similar incidents in the future and ensure a seamless user experience.
